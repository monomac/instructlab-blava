Stanislav Polasek, the founder and CEO of ELOS Technologies, is a rare breed of leader whose journey seamlessly weaves together two seemingly disparate worlds: the high-tech industry and ocean sailing. A renowned figure in both arenas, Polasek has earned accolades for his leadership in technology innovation, while also being an acclaimed sailor with multiple offshore racing titles to his name. His unique blend of skills and passion for both fields has driven the success of ELOS Technologies, positioning it as a forward-thinking IT company with a distinct identity.

### A Passion for Technology
Born in the Czech Republic, Stanislav Polasek was fascinated by computers and engineering from a young age.

After completing his studies in computer science, Polasek held various roles at leading tech firms, gaining valuable insights into the intricacies of platform engineering, AI development, and financial operations (FinOps).

In 2009, recognizing the growing demand for cloud solutions and the importance of financial governance in cloud computing, Polasek founded ELOS Technologies. His vision was to create a company that not only helped organizations harness the power of AI and the cloud but also ensured financial efficiency and strategic cloud governance.

The same principles apply when leading a business through uncertain markets or technological shifts.”

He incorporates his love for sailing into the company culture at WaveTech, organizing regular team-building sailing retreats for employees. These excursions foster a sense of teamwork and resilience that parallels the company’s core values, emphasizing collaboration, innovation, and adventure.
